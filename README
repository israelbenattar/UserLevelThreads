uthreads.cpp -- an user-level thread library.


REMARKS:

ANSWERS:

Q1:
when running merge-sort, its' reasonable because Context switch time is less, and in general
User level threads are cheap and fast, and UUser level thread does not require kernel mode privileges.
They can run on any operating system

Q2:
advantages:
Multiple processes without using threads use more resources.
in multiple processes each process operates independently of the others.
One thread can read, write or change another thread's data.
high overhead: all operations require a kernel trap, significant work

disadvantages:
In multiple processing environments, each process executes the same code but has its own memory and file resources.
Thread is light weight, taking lesser resources than a process.
All threads can share same set of open files, child processes.
Multiple threaded processes use fewer resources.
medium overhead: operations require a kernel trap, but little work.

Q3:
The signals and interrupts that are being involved are the SIGTERM signal that are triggered by user input using
the keyboard that sending a signal to the OS then the OS handle the signal by carefully closing the process that
are connected to the pid that the user insert (unless the default beaver was changed).

Q4:
real time is the time possesing in the system, whille virtual time is the time the process will run with no
interuptions,
using real time can be with time sharing, by aloocating time for each process.
using virtual time can be with a process that dealing with reality time like
a process that inerpert a live video stream.
